# puppy_photo_gallery: Frenchie Obsession


### Welcome to the Frenchie Obsession.
---------------------------------------

I wanted to take the time to learn how to use CSS Grid and so what better way to practice but with an awesome photo gallery displaying French Bulldogs!

Using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript to display a grid of french bulldog photos with the ability to hover & click on an image that will then render a modal.

**Here is what I came up with:**

Main View:
![Gallery View of Puppies](https://github.com/Amagonzalez27/puppy_photo_gallery/tree/master/assets/full_view.png)

When hovering over image:

Modal View:

Responsive View:
